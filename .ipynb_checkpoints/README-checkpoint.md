# This project is about classification of skin disease.  
## [A data set from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pacificrm/skindiseasedataset/data) with over 22 classifications was used for training. 
### Step 1: run the loadDataSet.ipynb to load in the data set. Run this only once.
### Step 2: All preprocessing and training is in FullSkinDiseaseProcess.ipynb. Results are all stored in the notebook. 
### Make sure your environment has tensorflow installed if you wish to rerun the results.
You may rerun FullSkinDiseaseProcess.ipynb file to check the results,  but warned that it may take up to 30 minutes plus for everything to finish running.
